The API returns this value from ``GET /api/version``. CLIs hard-block only when
their baked contract version differs, while ordinary build drift remains a soft
upgrade notice.

#: Breaking-change counter for the CLI/server contract. See module docstring.
# v2: claims organization_id widened to nullable for global/solution-managed claims (2026-06-13)
# v4: unified --org standard — SolutionCreate/SolutionBase drop `scope` (install
#     kind is derived from organization_id); SolutionRepoPreviewRequest gains
#     organization_id; descriptor no longer carries scope (2026-06-15)
# v5: Solution deploy is async: POST /deploy returns 202 + deploy_job_id and
#     callers poll SolutionDeployJobStatus for the deploy summary (2026-06-17)
# v6: Solution deploy uploads a workspace zip as multipart/form-data instead of
#     the legacy JSON bundle request body (2026-06-21)
# v7: Solution install (zip + from-repo) is async: POST /install and
#     /install/from-repo return 202 + deploy_job_id (was 200/201 + Solution);
#     callers poll SolutionDeployJobStatus (whose install_id is now nullable —
#     a zip install resolves its target inside the job) for the solution_id
#     (2026-07-02)
# v8: Application publish is async: POST /api/applications/{id}/publish returns
#     202 + PlatformJobAccepted (was 200 + ApplicationPublic); callers poll the
#     standardized PlatformJobPublic contract (2026-07-28)
# v9: PlatformJobStatus gained the waiting state used by durable parent jobs;
#     stale CLIs cannot parse that enum value and must upgrade (2026-08-07)
# v10: Solution deploy enqueue responses require candidate_id so the CLI can
#      prove the accepted job is bound to the exact reviewed bundle (2026-08-12)
# v11: Workspace promotion preview uses immutable artifact v2: production
#      source is bound to protected Git commit/tree, the server fetches reviewed
#      closure bytes, and response identities cover effective files and
#      registrations; server canaries accept reviewed artifacts only; prepare
#      emits an immutable authorization challenge, and activation accepts only
#      its tagged canary or exact risk-acknowledgement authorization
#      (2026-08-19)
# v12: Canonical table batch writes add explicit replacement modes and
#      count-only responses. New SDKs must not send these requests to an old
#      server that could ignore the mode; the separate bulk-upsert route is
#      removed (2026-09-12).
