"""CLI compatibility contract tripwire.

Two jobs:

1. **Runtime gate sync** — the CLI and server copies of the contract version
   must agree while ``GET /api/version`` exposes it for compatibility checks.

2. **Tripwire** — a fingerprint over the contract surface the CLI actually
   depends on (the request/response DTOs it sends + the routes it calls). Any
   change to that surface flips the fingerprint, failing this test until the
   author makes an explicit decision: bump ``CONTRACT_VERSION`` for a breaking
   change, or just refresh the fingerprint for a compatible additive/cosmetic
   change. This makes a missed compatibility decision a red test instead of a
   production incident.

The fingerprint is computed live, in-process, and only ever compared to a
constant committed in THIS file — never shipped or compared across machines —
so cross-machine schema-serialization differences are irrelevant.

#: above already catch. We keep only `/api/version` itself, since the gate's own
#: handshake depends on that literal path.

EXPECTED_CONTRACT_FINGERPRINT = (
    # Additive conditional document update DTOs; dedicated route fails closed on old servers.
    # ApplicationCreate.app_model default flipped inline_v1 → standalone_v2
    # (2026-06-13). CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 3: an old CLI would default a new
    # `apps create` to v1 against a v2-default server, so old clients are gated.
    #
    # SDKIntegrationsGetRequest gained optional `solution` (2026-06-14,
    # RequiredConnectionUnset escalation). ADDITIVE — an old CLI simply omits the
    # field and keeps silent-None behavior, so no CONTRACT_VERSION bump; fingerprint
    # refreshed only.
    #
    # Solution deploy now returns 202 + deploy_job_id and the CLI polls
    # SolutionDeployJobStatus for the prior summary shape (2026-06-17).
    # CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 5.
    #
    # Solution deploy now uploads a workspace zip as multipart/form-data instead
    # of the legacy JSON bundle request body (2026-06-21).
    # CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 6.
    #
    # TablePolicies policies union widened to list[Policy | PolicyRuleRef] (2026-06-23).
    # ADDITIVE: old CLIs send plain inline rules; PolicyRuleRef is a new optional
    # variant — no old client is broken. Fingerprint refreshed only.
    #
    # PolicyRuleCreate + PolicyRuleUpdate added to CLI contract surface (2026-06-23).
    # ADDITIVE: new entity group (policy-rule), no existing DTOs changed.
    # Fingerprint refreshed only.
    #
    # Solution install (zip + from-repo) is now async: POST /install and
    # /install/from-repo return 202 + deploy_job_id (was 200/201 + Solution) and
    # the CLI/UI poll SolutionDeployJobStatus for the solution_id. That job status'
    # install_id widened to nullable (a zip install resolves its target inside the
    # job) — a response-shape change the CLI parses (2026-07-02).
    # CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 7.
    #
    # Application publish now returns 202 + a standardized platform job instead
    # of ApplicationPublic, and the CLI polls PlatformJobPublic for durable
    # progress/result/error (2026-07-28). CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 8.
    #
    # Forms gained optional confirmation_markdown (2026-08-04). ADDITIVE: old
    # clients omit it and continue receiving the prior default confirmation.
    #
    # RoleCreate/RoleUpdate gained additive scopes fields (2026-07-30).
    # Old CLIs omit them and retain empty-scope custom-role behavior.
    # Forms also gained optional confirmation_markdown (2026-08-04). All are
    # additive; fingerprint refreshed after merging the contract surfaces.
    #
    # CLI/SDK file write and delete requests gained optional guarded-mutation
    # fields (2026-08-08). ADDITIVE: old clients omit them and retain the prior
    # unconditional behavior; new clients can reject stale writes and deletes.
    #
    # PlatformJobStatus gained `waiting` for durable parent jobs (2026-08-07).
    # CONTRACT_VERSION bumped to 9 because an older CLI cannot parse the new
    # enum value while polling PlatformJobPublic.
    # Fingerprint refreshed against the combined MTG fork and upstream v9
    # contract surfaces; the additional fork fields were already shipped.
    #
    # Solution deploy enqueue now requires candidate_id (2026-08-12), binding
    # an accepted asynchronous job to the exact reviewed bundle. CONTRACT_VERSION
    # bumped to 10 because a stale CLI cannot verify that invariant.
    #
    # Workspace promotion preview moved to immutable artifact v2 (2026-08-19):
    # reviewed production source is named by protected Git commit/tree, closure
    # bytes are server-fetched, and the response binds content, candidate,
    # release, effective file, and registration identities. CONTRACT_VERSION
    # bumped to 11 because v1 clients cannot safely interpret or activate v2.
    # The same unreleased v11 contract includes reviewed-artifact-only canary
    # request/acceptance DTOs, immutable preparation proof, and tagged
    # canary/risk-acknowledgement activation authorization; local draft uploads
    # are not executable.
    # Workspace release history status gained optional deadline, overdue, and
    # runtime/history verification fields (2026-08-24). ADDITIVE: v11 clients
    # ignore them and retain their existing pending/locked state handling.
    # Agent create/update replaced llm_model with llm_profile_id and the SDK AI
    # surface adopted reusable model profiles (2026-08-24). BREAKING: the
    # compatible CLI ships behind the unreleased 1.2.3 minimum-version floor.
    # Event subscriptions replaced the inert filter_expression string with the
    # structured criteria v1 contract (2026-08-26). BREAKING: the matching CLI
    # implementation ships in that same unreleased 1.2.3-gated release.
    # Additive attachment, artifact, model-profile, logo, usage-cache, and
    # platform-job memory fields are included in the same fingerprint refresh.
    # Reviewed promotion gained an optional declared multi-root cohort and
    # additive source-release evidence (2026-08-24). Single-root v11 clients
    # retain their existing request and response behavior.
    # Promotion responses gained optional risk_paths (2026-08-29). ADDITIVE:
    # old clients ignore it and retain their existing risk-class handling.
    # Promotion responses gained optional diagnostic delta/decision evidence
    # (2026-08-31). ADDITIVE: old clients ignore the extra response fields.
    # Workflow updates gained an optional execution retry policy (2026-09-03).
    # ADDITIVE: old clients omit it and workflows remain non-retryable by default.
