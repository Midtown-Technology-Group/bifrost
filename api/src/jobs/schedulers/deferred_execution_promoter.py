"""Deferred execution promoter.

Moves due schedules and durable unpublished submissions through the same
serialized publication transition used by run-now dispatch.

Design notes:

- Each row remains SCHEDULED until broker confirmation. An execution-keyed
  advisory lock prevents a concurrent publisher from dispatching it twice.
- Concurrent ticks may select the same candidate; the canonical publisher
  locks and rechecks its state before publication.
- ``LIMIT 500`` bounds recovery bursts after an outage — if 10k rows
  matured while the promoter was down, they drain in controlled batches.
- For legacy date-scheduled rows without dispatch evidence, ``user_email`` is
  intentionally an empty string: the Execution row does
  not persist the triggering user's email. The worker hydrates it from
  the User record keyed by ``executed_by``. ``startup=None`` for the same
  reason — startup results are per-session context and would be stale by
  the time a scheduled row matures.
