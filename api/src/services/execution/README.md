# Execution Engine

Distributed execution system for running workflows, scripts, and data providers
in fresh isolated processes. PostgreSQL is authoritative for durable workflow
identity and status and is the active production work-delivery backend. Delivery
rows are claimed with leases, renewed by heartbeats, fenced by ownership, and
recovered through explicit interrupted-delivery handling. Redis carries bounded
ephemeral context, live logs, cancellation signals, and synchronous results.
RabbitMQ remains a supported compatibility transport and test surface, but it is
not the current production delivery path.

## Key Files

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `service.py` | High-level orchestration. Workflow lookup by ID, metadata caching, sync/async dispatch routing, and PostgreSQL fallback when a synchronous Redis wait expires. Entry point for `run_workflow()` and `run_code()`. |
| `engine.py` | Unified execution engine. Handles workflows, inline scripts, and data providers. Sets up SDK context, captures variables via `sys.settrace()`, streams logs to Redis, handles data provider caching. |
| `async_executor.py` | Dispatch management. Pins immutable execution/runtime evidence in PostgreSQL, stores ephemeral context in Redis, publishes a minimal RabbitMQ message, and returns the execution ID. |
| `process_pool.py` | One-shot child lifecycle management. Forks on demand up to `max_workers`, handles timeouts (SIGTERM -> SIGKILL), detects crashes, and publishes heartbeats. |
| `simple_worker.py` | Isolated subprocess entry point. Receives one parent-assembled context over a private pipe, clears workspace modules, delegates to `engine.py`, returns one result, and exits. |
| `workflow_execution.py` | RabbitMQ consumer. Claims a durable attempt, resolves pinned metadata, routes to the process pool, token-fences results, flushes data, and publishes updates. |

## Execution States

```text
SCHEDULED   Durable execution exists; publication is unconfirmed or deferred
    |
    v
PENDING     Broker publication confirmed
    |
    v
RUNNING     Consumer claimed the run (attempt records claim/start separately)
    |
    +---> SUCCESS              Completed successfully
    |
    +---> FAILED               Execution error (exception thrown)
    |
    +---> COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS  Returned {success: false}
    |
    +---> TIMEOUT              Exceeded timeout_seconds
    |
    +---> CANCELLED            User cancelled via API
```

An authorized cancellation may project `CANCELLING` between `RUNNING` and
`CANCELLED`. Historical executions created before attempt tracking return
`legacy_unavailable` coverage rather than a fabricated attempt.

## Data Flow

### Async Execution (Default)

1. API calls `run_workflow()` or `run_code()`
2. `async_executor.py` creates a PostgreSQL `SCHEDULED` row and `dispatching`
   attempt with immutable dispatch/runtime evidence under the execution lock
3. Ephemeral context is stored in Redis and the durable work envelope is inserted
   into PostgreSQL in the same fenced dispatch flow
4. The same fenced transaction advances the logical row to `PENDING` and the
   attempt to `published`
5. The PostgreSQL delivery runner claims available rows with an owner-scoped lease.
   Each active delivery is heartbeat-renewed; loss or uncertainty of ownership
   cancels the handler rather than allowing an unfenced result.
6. Consumer atomically claims `PENDING`, assigning the durable attempt an
   internal capability token and worker incarnation
7. Consumer resolves pinned metadata and routes a fresh child through
   `ProcessPoolManager`
8. Delivery settlement occurs only while lease ownership is still valid. Worker
   shutdown or lease expiry marks work interrupted so the delivery layer can
   recover it deliberately rather than assuming an external side effect is safe
   to replay.
9. The pool copies the token into real and synthetic timeout/cancel/crash
   results returned over the private result pipe
10. Consumer accepts only the active token, terminalizing attempt and logical
    execution before publishing updates
11. Client treats WebSocket updates as live hints and reloads durable detail

PostgreSQL delivery retries are bounded to pre-execution failures selected by the
shared consumer policy. Interrupted rows are recovered through the durable
lease/recovery path. Tenant workflow code is never automatically replayed after
execution begins. RabbitMQ retains analogous retry/poison behavior when the
legacy/compatibility transport is selected.

Persisted inline-code execution retains a legacy Redis-first creation path and
therefore reports unavailable attempt coverage until that path is reconciled.
Transient editor execution is intentionally not durable.

### Sync Execution (Tool Calls, `sync=True`)

1. Steps 1-8 same as async
2. Consumer pushes result to Redis list: `bifrost:result:{execution_id}`
3. API waits on `BLPOP` for result (up to timeout)
4. If that Redis wait expires, API checks the authoritative PostgreSQL execution
   projection for a terminal result
5. API returns the durable terminal result when present, otherwise the polling
   timeout response

```python
# Sync execution with BLPOP
result = await redis_client.wait_for_result(execution_id, timeout_seconds=1800)
```

## SDK Context Injection

The execution engine injects context for the Bifrost SDK:

```python
# engine.py sets up context before execution
from bifrost._context import set_execution_context

context = ExecutionContext(
    user_id=request.caller.user_id,
    email=request.caller.email,
    organization=request.organization,
    execution_id=request.execution_id,
    _config=request.config,      # Integration credentials
    startup=request.startup,     # Launch workflow results
    roi=roi,                     # ROI tracking
)
set_execution_context(context)
```

Workflows access via:
```python
from bifrost import context

# Available in @workflow functions
context.user_id
context.organization.name
context.startup["launch_workflow_result"]
```

## Error Handling

### Timeouts

Process pool monitors execution duration:

```python
# process_pool.py
if elapsed > exec_info.timeout_seconds:
    # 1. Send SIGTERM for graceful shutdown
    os.kill(pid, signal.SIGTERM)

    # 2. Wait grace period
    await asyncio.sleep(graceful_shutdown_seconds)

    # 3. Force kill if still running
    os.kill(pid, signal.SIGKILL)

    # 4. Report timeout via callback
    await on_result({
        "execution_id": exec_info.execution_id,
        "success": False,
        "error_type": "TimeoutError",
    })
```

### Process Crashes

Pool detects crashed processes and reports any interrupted execution. The
next request forks a fresh one-shot child:

```python
# process_pool.py
if not handle.is_alive and handle.state != ProcessState.KILLED:
    # Report crash if execution was in progress
    if handle.current_execution:
        await _report_crash(handle.current_execution)

    # The next route_execution call forks on demand
```

### Cancellation

Cancellation requests via Redis pub/sub:

```python
# Client publishes to bifrost:cancel channel
await redis.publish("bifrost:cancel", {"execution_id": "..."})

# Pool listens and kills the process
await _handle_cancel_request(execution_id)
```

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_workers` | 10 | Maximum worker processes |
| `execution_timeout_seconds` | 300 | Process-pool fallback; registered workflows carry pinned timeout policy |
| `graceful_shutdown_seconds` | 5 | Time between SIGTERM and SIGKILL |
| `worker_heartbeat_interval_seconds` | 10 | Heartbeat publish interval |
| `worker_registration_ttl_seconds` | 30 | Redis registration TTL |

Environment variables:
```bash
BIFROST_MAX_WORKERS=10
BIFROST_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

## Template Recycling

Execution children are never reused. After a package install or manual recycle
request, the pool lets active one-shot children drain and restarts the
long-lived import template. The next execution forks from the new template.

## Redis Keys

| Key Pattern | Purpose | TTL |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| `bifrost:pending:{execution_id}` | Pending execution context | 1 hour |
| `bifrost:exec:{execution_id}:context` | Worker process context | 1 hour |
| `bifrost:result:{execution_id}` | Sync execution result (BLPOP) | 1 hour |
| `bifrost:pool:{worker_id}` | Worker registration/heartbeat | 30 seconds |
| `bifrost:logs:{execution_id}` | Real-time log stream | Until flush |
| `bifrost:workflow:metadata:{workflow_id}` | Cached workflow metadata | 5 minutes |
