"""
Process Pool Manager for Execution Isolation.

Each execution forks a fresh worker process from a long-lived template
and the worker exits after returning its result. There is no warm pool;
the only throttles are `max_workers` (concurrency cap) and a cgroup
memory-pressure check on the way in.

Key features:
- One-shot worker processes (fork → run one execution → exit)
- Cap concurrent forks at `max_workers`; queued executions wait on a
  condition variable that is notified when a worker exits
- Memory-pressure admission control (cgroup working-set)
- Automatic timeout handling with graceful shutdown (SIGTERM -> SIGKILL)
- Crash detection
- Heartbeat publishing for UI visibility
- Drain + template restart after pip install (so future forks pick up
  newly installed packages); also exposed as a manual "recycle" RPC

Architecture:
    ProcessPoolManager (runs in consumer process)
        |
        +-- up to max_workers concurrent one-shot children
        +-- Each child: work_queue (in) + result_queue (out)
        +-- Monitor loop checks health and timeouts
        +-- Result loop collects execution results
        +-- Heartbeat loop publishes status to Redis/WebSocket
