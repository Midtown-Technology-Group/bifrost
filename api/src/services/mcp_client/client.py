"""Auto-negotiating Streamable HTTP MCP client, per connection.

Exactly one transport: FastMCP's supported HTTP client. It probes the modern
``server/discover`` path first and falls back to the legacy ``initialize``
handshake only when the peer does not provide positive modern-era evidence.
No SSE or stdio transports are exposed here.

The caller — ``dispatch.invoke`` and ``catalog_sync.sync_catalog`` — owns
auth resolution. By the time we get the ``access_token`` here, the caller
has already decided whether the vendor will see the user identity or the
service identity. This module only carries bytes over a wire.

    Entering FastMCP's client context performs modern-first negotiation. The

    ``call_tool_mcp``; callers use those so Bifrost preserves the SDK's
    ``CallToolResult`` rather than FastMCP's convenience result wrapper.

    Args:
        connection: The ``MCPConnection`` row whose server URL (or override)
            we dial. The connection's ``server`` relationship must already
            be loaded — callers fetch it with ``joinedload`` or rely on the
            ORM's eager-load default.
        access_token: The Bearer token to send. Resolution of which token
            to use (per-user vs. shared service) happens in ``auth_resolution``;
            this layer is auth-agnostic.
