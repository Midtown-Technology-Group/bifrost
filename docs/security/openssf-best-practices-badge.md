# OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (MTG fork)

Project **13022**: https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/13022

Upstream earned Passing as [project 12665](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/12665).
The MTG fork maintains its own `.bestpractices.json` at the repo root and tracks
semver releases from **v1.0.0** ([VERSIONING.md](../VERSIONING.md)).

## Current status

| Tier | Typical progress | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| **Passing** | 100% | Met after v1.0.0 tag, release notes, and JSON refresh ([#298](https://github.com/MTG-Thomas/bifrost/pull/298)) |
| **Baseline tier 1 (OSPS)** | ~65%+ | OSPS answers import on the **baseline-1** form, not Passing or Silver |
| **Silver** | In progress | Governance/docs/coverage rings ([#286](https://github.com/MTG-Thomas/bifrost/issues/286)–[#293](https://github.com/MTG-Thomas/bifrost/issues/293), [#290](https://github.com/MTG-Thomas/bifrost/issues/290)) |

```

## BadgeApp forms (separate pages)

BadgeApp does **not** share one form across tiers. After merging `.bestpractices.json`
to `main`, sign in and run **Save (and continue) 🤖** on each tier you are updating:

| Tier | Edit URL |
|------|----------|
| Passing | https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/13022/passing/edit |
| Baseline tier 1 (OSPS) | https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/13022/baseline-1/edit |
| Silver | https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/13022/silver/edit |

**Common mistake:** Saving only on Passing or Silver does not apply OSPS baseline
answers — use **baseline-1** for those fields. Silver metal criteria (governance,
documentation depth, coverage, signed releases) need matching entries in
`.bestpractices.json` *and* a Silver form save.

## Regenerate answers

```powershell
python .\scripts\generate-bestpractices-json.py
```

Commit the regenerated `.bestpractices.json` to `main` before BadgeApp import.

Governance-related Silver fields are justified from [GOVERNANCE.md](../../GOVERNANCE.md),
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
(the applicable contribution route). The maintainer-directed route is an alternate
project acceptance record, not evidence that every commit has a personal DCO
certification. Before importing contribution-related answers, reassess the exact
criterion and its justification against the adopted policy. Do not infer badge
compliance or DCO equivalence from an agent's authorization/provenance record.

The contribution-related `dco_status` is **unresolved (`?`)** pending verification
of the applicable legal mechanism and criterion basis. Ordinary contributions
retain DCO 1.1; the alternate route does not assert personal certification.
The generator explicitly preserves this disposition even if upstream input says
`Met`. Adoption of the contribution policy does not resolve the badge criterion
or update the externally hosted BadgeApp answers.

## Submit answers (pick one path)

### Path A — repo automation (recommended)

1. Merge `.bestpractices.json` on `main` (must be visible to BadgeApp).
2. Sign in at [bestpractices.dev](https://www.bestpractices.dev/).
3. Open the edit page for the tier you are updating (table above).
4. Click **Save (and continue) 🤖** so BadgeApp imports the repo file and runs
   its own detectors.

### Path B — direct API-style submit

1. Sign in to [bestpractices.dev](https://www.bestpractices.dev/).
2. Copy the `_BadgeApp_session` cookie (DevTools → Application → Cookies).
3. Submit locally:

```powershell
$env:BADGE_COOKIE = '<paste cookie value>'
$env:BADGE_LEVEL = 'passing'   # or baseline-1, silver
python .\scripts\submit-openssf-badge.py
```

Cookie lifetime is ~48 hours. `BADGE_LEVEL` defaults to `passing`.
