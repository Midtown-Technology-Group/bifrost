# Workspace source coherence

## Contract

Object storage under `_repo/` is the durable source of truth. Every Python path
also has a content version (`sha256`) and is served to workflow imports through
the Redis module cache. The workspace generation is an execution fence, not a
second source revision.

A cached global workspace module is usable only when all of these are true:

- its cached content hashes to its recorded `sha256`;
- that hash is the byte version written from `_repo/`;
- its cache generation equals the current ready workspace generation; and
- its path is present in the module index stamped with that generation.

Legacy entries without a generation and entries from an older generation are
cache misses. The reader loads exact `_repo/` bytes and repopulates Redis. A
cold read captures the generation before object-storage access and rechecks it
afterward, so a read that overlaps a source write cannot label old bytes as the
new generation.

`file_index` is a derived search index, never a recovery copy of source. The
scheduled reconciler may rebuild missing or stale index rows from `_repo/` and
remove orphaned rows, but it must never write indexed content back to object
storage. Storage listings must consume every provider page before deciding that
an indexed path is absent; a partial listing is not deletion evidence.

Python writes run behind `workspace_source_update`. The writer first publishes
an `updating:<token>` barrier, writes durable/index/cache state, publishes the
same token as the ready generation, and then proves the changed paths coherent.
The operation does not report ordinary completion before that proof. A durable
changeset activation whose final runtime proof fails remains `activated` and
returns `failure_detail.phase=runtime_propagation`; callers must not retry the
source mutation.

## Immutable release imports

The shared dependency collector includes available parent `__init__.py` files
when resolving a submodule import, and follows their transitive dependencies.
This applies to absolute, relative and literal dynamic imports. Namespace
packages contribute no invented initializer. Initializers receive the same
resource and uncertainty checks as other source, without executing their bytes
during review. Updating the collector requires reconciling reviewed recipe
mappings against the expanded closure before enabling delivery on that SDK.

An execution pinned to a Workspace release resolves every targeted module,
package, and namespace against that release's source manifest. Concrete imports
load verified bytes from its immutable storage prefix through the same reader
as the entry workflow. Mutable resolver hits, misses, and namespace probes are
not consulted. A declared module whose immutable bytes are unavailable fails
closed; a path absent from the manifest is not a workspace import.

This distinction matters immediately after activation: runtime source is ready
before asynchronous history projection has populated the mutable workspace.
New helpers must load during that interval, and old mutable helpers must never
replace the version pinned by the execution. History completion is not an import
prerequisite and must not be repaired by reactivating a coherent release.

## Release behavior

`GET /api/workspace-repo-changesets/state` reports runtime mismatches separately
from durable `file_hashes`. Exact-byte `verify` mutations are activatable when
the durable bytes are already correct but Redis content, generation, or index is
not. Validation binds those runtime-repair paths into the immutable candidate;
activation rotates the generation, reconstructs the exact cache entries from
object storage, and records runtime evidence in `activation_evidence`.

This is the supported repair for “durable source current, runtime stale.” It
must not manufacture a source change or a Git history commit.

## Outage recovery boundary

Execution orphan cleanup remains short, idempotent scheduler housekeeping in
`api/src/jobs/schedulers/execution_cleanup.py`. It already uses worker
heartbeats and bounded age thresholds, and should not become a workflow or a
bespoke job table. Running PlatformJobs are already fenced and recovered after
lease expiry by `api/src/jobs/schedulers/platform_jobs.py`.

Queued Git jobs retain operator intent and therefore must not be discarded only
because execution capacity was unavailable. Operators may cancel obsolete jobs
through the shared PlatformJob API. If the product later needs automatic
abandonment, add an explicit expiry/supersession contract to PlatformJob rather
than a workspace-specific cleanup job.
